# Inter-team Evaluation Response

## Feedback received summarized:
### Interface Design & Usability
- The overall layout of the app is pretty intuitive and the Pistachio theme was a user favorite
- The overall layout of the application is very clean and intuitive users appreciated having three different color modes for the user interface
- This app seems to meet all the needs that it had planned to meet as users can use it in all functionalities as planned

### Task Page Design & Functionality
- It's easy to add a task, and create a label but "label" could possibly be renamed to "category," to make the feature more intuitive
- It is easy and intuitive to add tasks, but possibly add a way to color code the tasks
- Improve the UI/UX of the tasks list because that seems kind of plain right now and possibly color code the tasks to keep it more organized
- This feature was really intuitive and easy to use, it was easy to add/delete tasks. Users liked being able to add a due date and also an approximation of how long it'll take. This kept things neat and users liked that the tasks were automatically added to the upcoming deadlines chart
- It is easy to add and remove tasks, overall the page is intuitive. Some features that could potentially be added include a priority label, a label to distinguish between different types of tasks (events vs tasks), and a small description/notes section to a task (expand/hide description)

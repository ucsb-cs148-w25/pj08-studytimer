# Inter-team Evaluation Response
1. Feedback based on your own USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
2. A summary of the features of the product as the other team understood them, and what they liked or thought could be improved about each
3. How effective it was to use the project in its current state (comments about the robustness of the app and the current UI/UX design)
4. A summary of how the other team was able to follow the deployment instructions and how helpful / organized the other team found your team's repo
   (README.md, Kanban Board, maybe code).
6. The other team's final closing thoughts: something they liked, the most impactful opportunity for improvement, and one more thing they thought was good.

## Discussion
Peer evaluation feedback, summarized by Jennifer:
- Color coding the tasks and labels
- Include priority label
- Timer UI shows break more clearly
- Optimize icon appearance for dark mode
- Profile page button not obvious

Decisions:
- Display break timer on top of ice overlay
- Make profile page as a button more obvious (replace name with profile icon)
- Make changes to the Task Page based on user feedback (renaming, coloring) - Let's not prioritize it!
- Work on making app more customizable for users

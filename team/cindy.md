# Hello team!

## About Me
This is Cindy, I'm a 3rd year computer science student interested in AI/ML! I'm most comfortable in data analysis and visualization with Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) and database querying with SQL.

## Study Timer Project
I'm excited for this project because I struggle with being focused especially when studying with friends. I hope that we can implement some sort of feature that allows for study groups to use to stay on track!

If it's in our capacity, I would love to add integrations to Google Calendar and study spot recommendations (potentially using ML)!

## Final Notes
I'm excited to work with everyone and make a cool app :D

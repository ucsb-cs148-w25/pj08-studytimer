## Scribed Discussion:
_Format: Updates, blockers, working on._

Cindy: Finished calendar component layout, waiting on Google sign-in to be set up to import events. Working on design with Edwin/Andrew and will look into backend this weekend.

Andrew: Worked on settings pop-up! Lot cleaner to input the time, no blockers, will work alongside Edwin to make icons. 

Kevin: Set up backend with Google Auth. Blocker: can't get user info, will work on more backend. Found a different deployment for backend (Render).

Jennifer: Added metrics to tasks that we could implement on the homepage. No blockers, move on to backend!

Thienan: Finished About page and set up a temporary settings page. Will fix the color of the titles! Waiting for the other PRs to be accepted to implement new changes since code is currently behind.

Larry: Fixed tiny bug on the tasks (can't edit and then save the edited task). Waiting for sign-in to implement Firebase for task backend. Will work on setting up Firebase as backend.

Edwin: Redesigned the navbar using Gauchobike as model. Created interactability for the sign-in ("hello USER!"). Planning to work with Kevin on the sign in and work with Andrew on creating icons to reuce the text on the screen. Might work on the settings page (account settings) too.

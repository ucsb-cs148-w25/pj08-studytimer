## Scribed Discussion:

Cindy: Made logo, added it to navbar and tab icon. Working on React tutorial and Google Calendar integration.

Andrew: UI tutorials, work on design, will work on updating homepage.

Kevin: Did initial deployment, created issues, no blockers. Will be working on fixing a bug that our page doesn't show up correctly on mobile.

Jennifer: Finished issues for lab02, looking into UI for the app, no blockers. Will work on more issues as they are added.

Thienan: Made a profile page, need to add Google OAuth and username, no blockers.

Larry: Finished lab02 issues, currently working on todo list feature and backend features such as adding/deleting tasks using Firebase. For now working on frontend, no blockers.

Edwin: Nearly finished OAuth Consent Screen, our web app needs a terms of service and privacy usage so we can get verification by Google to access userâ€™s Google Calendar events and availabilities. Also did the OAuth API Credentials, so users (once the backend is set up) will be able to log-in and see that our app is asking for x, y, and z. Outside of that, updated README.md for the project to be a little organized and in preparation for lab03. Will work on backend, most likely will go on Flask.

- Abandon templates, can always pull features from existing templates
- Retro action - communicating resources to team members

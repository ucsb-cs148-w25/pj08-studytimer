## Scribed Discussion:
_Format: Updates, blockers, working on._

Cindy: Updated MVP video demo, no blockers, will work on syncing calendar component, themes with Edwin, and creating personalized study plan.

Andrew: Worked on the homepage, tried to form a circular progress bar, not in sync with current React version, work towards fixing this bug and alternative homepages.

Kevin + Jennifer: Set up Google OAuth, gave up on Flask, switched over to Springboot for backend, set up Firebase database, Google login works! The calendar isn't syncing! Shared google doc with private keys for local testing. Planning to push changes after MVP review. No blockers! Continue working on backend.

Thienan: No blockers, did the About page, work on the profile/sign-in page now that OAuth works.

Larry: Blocker is no laptop for now. Using CSIL computer for work during lab times. Plan to work on Firebase database for task manager.

Edwin: (sent via team chat) I've been working on Figma to create a few icons for the app, such as a drop down icon for the future Account Settings/Log Out toggle, and the settings icon to simplify the homepage. Additionally, I revamped many of the files on the app for frontend to make them compatible with the new themes Iâ€™ve been developing, you can test them out on the Draft PR I have up! So a lot of new CSS files will be merged into main after the MVP, that will most likely be my issue/contribution for Lab04. Working on updating README with installation instructions.

## General Notes:

*Action Items:*
- Update README with installation instructions.
- Update Github release for MVP!

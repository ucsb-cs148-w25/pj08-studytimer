# Inter-team Evaluation Response

## Summary of Feedback Received:
### Interface Design & Usability
- The overall layout of the app is pretty intuitive and the Pistachio theme was a user favorite
- The overall layout of the application is very clean and intuitive users appreciated having three different color modes for the user interface
- This app seems to meet all the needs that it had planned to meet as users can use it in all functionalities as planned

### Task Page Design & Functionality
- It's easy and intuitive to add a task, and create a label but "label" could possibly be renamed to "category," to make the feature more intuitive
- Consider adding a way to color code the tasks
- The UI/UX of the tasks list is a bit plain as of right now -> possibly add option to color code tasks to keep them more organized
- Users liked being able to add a due date and also an approximation of how long it'll take. This kept things neat and users liked that the tasks were automatically added to the upcoming deadlines chart
- Potentially include a priority label, a label to distinguish between different types of tasks (events vs tasks), and a small description/notes section to a task (expand/hide description)

### Features of Timer
- There is a functional timer that users can use in order to time their study sessions and tasks
- Feature could be a little more clear about when the breaks will happen
- The start and reset buttons are easy to view and make sense and the settings option is a nice addition to provide user autonomy; However, the settings button should be more visible in dark mode

## Decisions Moving Forward
We have decided to focus on the following:
- Make break system more intuitive for users (possibly display break time left on top of ice overlay)
- Make Profile Page more obvious in the navigation bar
- Make changes to the Task Page based on user feedback (renaming, coloring)
- Work on making app more customizable for users

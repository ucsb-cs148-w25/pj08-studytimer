I am currently a 4th year CS Major. I have done both web development and mobile development (CS184),
where I created a Shopping Cart App targeted for group settings i.e. households/roommates.
I have had experience working with React/React Native, Firebase, and many programming languages
such as Javascript, Java, Python, C++, and etc.

For some ideas for the study timer, I was wondering if we could implement a section dedicated to study techniques
(i.e. Pomodoro) so users could select them to follow while studying. Also we could add functionality like white noise,
rewards, etc. to motivate/help users study more efficiently

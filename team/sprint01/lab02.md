Cindy finished her hello world demo for lab01 using React. She's working on adding to the user journey and problem scenario descriptions with notes from the last sprint planning meeting where her teammates shared user personas. She's also looking into Next.js to use for the app!

Kevin completed the hello world and demoed it to a instructor. He will work towards the MVP with React.

Andrew created a Study Timer Web App using React and ran the demo locally. He is is interested in creating a mobile app too, so he's looking into React Native! He has no current troubles.

Lawrence finished his hello world demo, added License and .gitignore files to our repo, and will start working on more lab02 deliverables. He has no current blockers.

Edwin finished his Hello World aspect of lab01, and demoed it to a ULA. He is working toward understanding Tailwind and Next.js and maybe spend some more time planning concrete features. Currently, he has no troubles!

Thienan finished the hello world demo in React and demoed to a ULA during lab02. He also created a user journey and problem scenario description file and merged it, so that Cindy can contribute to it!

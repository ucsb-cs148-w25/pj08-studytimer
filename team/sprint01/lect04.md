Andrew: Messed with React Native, ran into problems, couldnâ€™t get it to launch properly. Worked on design.

Kevin: Found out we can use templates! Added auto request reviewers, working towards first deployment, got stuck on Next.js. Made kanban board.

Jennifer: No updates, working on MVP moving forward.

Thienan: No updates, start working towards MVP.

Larry: Lab02 addendum, maybe look into Next.js, would be fine with Next.js, working toward MVP/kanban board.

## General Notes:

*Technology?*
- Next.js has templates
    - More aesthetically pleasing
    - Less front-end work
- React templates: Stick with React, play it safe for MVP, can messing with other tech stacks after
- Deployment: Use Netlify - Auto refreshes for pushes, bad URLs

*User stories (Sprint 3):*
- As a user, I can add my tasks to my calendar, so that I can view what’s coming up during the week or month.
- As a user, I can view my daily tasks from the task board on the homepage, so that I have an idea of what I have to do during the day.
- As a user, I can create and record study sessions based on my tasks and energy levels, so that I can balance productivity and rest and reflect on my previous work.

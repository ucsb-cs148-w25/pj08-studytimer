### Individual Reflections

Team member: Kevin  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We need to stop completing labs at the last minute. | So that our reviewers have more time to review code and to deliver higher quality final products. |
| Start | We need to start adding initials and correct labels to PRs. | So that the project is more organized and I don’t have to go back and add it. |
| Continue | We need to continue giving updates and being clear to each other with updates. | So that we deliver all the features that we promised our users. |

Team member: Edwin  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Forgetting to do parts of the lab | If we forget about all the deliverables for the lab, we might be completely missing or rushing what needs to be done by the end of the week. Reviewing earlier in the week as a team, will help ensure the last few labs we have are completed early! |
| Start | Helping others to ensure that the remaining features we need to deliver, are bug-free! | Finding bugs can help us have a better experience when the staff team goes thru our project during finals week. And if you have extra time, try to debug it yourself! |
| Continue | The solid communication! | Helps know what’s currently being done by the team, and where we can allocate our ‘resources’ for these last two weeks.  |

Team member: Thienan  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Stop working on labs at the last minute | So that we have everything ready before Friday so we can just check to make sure everything is correct and to not lose points |
| Start | Working on polishing our product for our final presentation | So that there are no bugs for our final project and everything is working properly |
| Continue | Reviewing each others PRs | So that every one’s PRs is working correctly and accepted in a timely manner|

Team member: Lawrence  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Waiting until last minute to finish hws/labs | Allow the team to get the full points so everyone is on point |
| Start | Setting up final touches for application | The most important features should be bug-free in order to show a complete application during our final presentation |
| Continue | Pushing/Reviewing team PR’s | The application will be further enhanced and team members can confirm whether the implemented code is properly working |

Team member: Jennifer  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Waiting to finish parts of the lab until we meet at section | If we get the lab finished early we can have time to make sure that all parts are completed on time |
| Start | Working on the final features for the final deadline | The final code freeze will be next Friday so we should focus on making sure that our project is ready by then |
| Continue | Working on features for our current user stories | Some user stories from our last Sprint haven’t been finished yet so we can try to finish those first before moving on to newer stories |

Team member: Cindy  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Completing labs from the previous week at the last minute | So that we can start our next week right away and have more development time |
| Start | Enforcing stricter deadlines for issues | So that we can deliver features faster and finish our main functionality before the code freeze and final release! |
| Continue | Providing clear communication through our group chats | So that everyone on the team is on the same page and knows what’s going on |

Team member: Andrew  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Stop skimming over important parts of our lab. | If we brush over what needs to be completed for our lab we may not get the full points and could rush over important tasks. |
| Start | Start focusing on the final touches we wish to complete for our final code freeze. | If we begin focusing on the what final tasks we want to accomplish we can make sure our final code freeze looks how we intend our webapp to perform for our users. |
| Continue | Continue working on the user stories.| This helps us make sure that all the important features we sought out to complete get done and make sure we aren’t leaving any functionality behind.|

## Group Reflection
Some of the user stories that we created at the beginning of the course, and the following sprints, haven’t fully been met, so there’s a bit of missing features/actions the user can do with our current application. Rather than getting on board with new features, or new user stories, we should ensure previous user stories are met for a more cohesive final product. Everyone should be on board for an issue that meets the remaining user stories we have! This is our best shot to ensure that everything is properly met before the final version.

## Retro Outcome

- For this retro, I chose to lead with the Start/Stop/Continue method. This allowed the team to identify what was/wasn't working from our previous Sprint planning meeting.
- Once everyone had contributed their observations, we took a vote on which action was most important in order to identify this week's priority and moving forward to complete the project.

## Retro Report
- Success: 
    - Every member of the group had clear-cut responsibilities and roles that helped everyone stay on task and complete their intended issues.
- A goal:
    - Making sure that our user stories have fully complete features before moving on to new ones
- A commitment: 
    - Work on unfamiliar branches/code blocks for features that may be lacking behind the final vision of our app, to ensure that they are fully through and ready for staff and our final presentation
    - Prepare what you will be saying/display (essentially give a tutorial for) for the final presentation, so that the last week of the product can go smooth!

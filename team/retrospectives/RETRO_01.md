## Action item
### Individual Reflections

Team member: Jennifer  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We should stop waiting until class to decide in which direction we’re going. | It makes us feel unprepared in terms of deciding what issues need to be addressed first. Additionally, it makes it harder to make deadlines. |
| Start  | We should start giving updates regularly on Discord/Slack so we can gauge our team’s current progress | We mostly give each other updates during in person meetings but we should be engaging more outside of class as well.|
| Continue | We should continue working towards closing current issues on the Kanban board before moving onto other issues. | This will make everything flow easier and keep things organized. |

Team member: Lawrence  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We should stop only doing issues during class. | It slows down progress of project and potential deadlines. |
| Start  | We should start updating people regarding individual branches to test out implemented features as well as provide documentation for testing if needed. | It allows members to know what to expect in testing the features. |
| Continue | We should continue to provide useful tools in discord channel when members may have trouble implementing respective issues. | Everyone knows what each other is responsible for so no redundant work is done. Tools can also help members struggling on their issues.|

Team member: Edwin  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We should stop unnecessarily expanding the project span or jumping onto new features that could be included. | While it’s good to keep thinking of new stuff to add to our app, there are other features that are more important to the user stories and the team’s overall invision of the application we are creating. Additionally, you have to consider that there are deadlines (MVP for example) that expect a minimum product or a working feature, so focus on those first! |
| Start  | We should start looking at existing resources/documentation that can support the implementation of features | Prevent re-inventing the wheel, lots of documentation out there for creating a button OR, as mentioned in slack, we can use templates! |
| Continue | We should continue to keep git and team relations/occupations up to date. | Good to just have an understanding of where/what everyone is with the feature they are working on, and ensuring github is up-to-date prevents merge conflicts! |

Team member: Kevin  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We need to stop doing things last minute | So that reviewers have more time to thoroughly check before the deadlines. | 
| Start  | We need to start meeting up outside of class. | So we have more time as a team together to collaborate and help each other out on issues we are stuck on. |
| Continue | We need to continue being organized on github. | So we are up to date on the latest features we are working on to meet our expectations. |

Team member: Cindy  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We need to  stop waiting until classes to work on the project. | Working on the project outside of class allows for faster progress and more effective and efficient team meetings. |
| Start  | We need to start holding story time and sprint planning meetings, even scheduling outside of class. | We should flush out our product backlog with acceptance conditions to organize our project better! |
| Continue | We need to continue holding stand-ups at the start of class. | Although we update each other over Discord and Slack, having the daily meeting for 15 minutes at the start of each class helps keep everyone on the same page. |

Team member: Andrew  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We need to stop creating overcomplicated issues/tasks. | By creating smaller issues/tasks for our group to focus on we can tackle small portions at a time and be more efficient. |
| Start  | We need to start working more outside of class. | By spending more time outside of class we are able to work ahead of schedule. |
| Continue | We need to start coming up with innovative ideas. | By coming up with more creative ideas we can improve our webapp’s functionality and draw in more users. |

Team member: Thienan  
| Start/Stop/Continue  | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We need to stop only discussing what we have done in class. | It will be more time effective to discuss our plans outside of class. |
| Start  | We need to start working on the features we want for our MVP. | This will allow us to have a MVP by the deadline! |
| Continue | We need to continue communicating with the team on everyone’s progress. | This helps keep the team updated on what everyone is doing. |

### Group Reflection
* A goal: We will continue to communicate on Discord to keep everyone on the same page while also providing useful tools in the channel for when members might have trouble implementing respective issues.
* A change/experiment: If we communicate more resources and solutions to issues that come up, we hope that others can resolve their issues sooner and more efficiently, ultimately resulting in faster progress.
* A measurement: We will ask group members how their tasks are coming along at the end of every class/week; Documentation can be pinned in the discord channel for easier access!


## Retro Assessment
* For this retro, I chose to lead with the Start/Stop/Continue method. This allowed the team to identify what was/wasn't working from our previous Sprint planning meeting.
* Once everyone had contributed their observations, we took a vote on which action was most important in order to identify this week's priority/experiment.  
* For the next retrospective, I recommend allocating (and sitting to) a specific amount of time for both individual and group reflections. This will ensure that all our necessary discussions are completed before the lab session ends.


## Experiment/Change
During our experiement, we definitely increased our asynchronous communication outside of class on our Discord channel. While not all team members used it consistently to share resources, those who did found it useful in resolving issues faster. Additionally, the Slack help channels were pretty helpful in learning more about how to solve merge conflicts, rebasing branches, etc. Overall, our 'change' allowed us to address troubleshooting issues before class/in-person meetings. 

Going forward, we will continue using Slack/Discord for updates and troubleshooting. We will all try to be more active on the channels in order for unresolved issues to be addressed before our next meeting.

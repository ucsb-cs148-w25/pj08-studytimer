## Action item

### Individual Reflections

Team member: Kevin  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We need to stop doing things last minute | So that we submit more quality work and reduce stress amongst team members |
| Start | We need to start putting in more time | So that we can complete the project as we are reaching the deadline and each team member needs to put in more time to complete it. |
| Continue | We need to continue writing good documentation | So that other team members can further build and improve existing features. |

Team member: Edwin  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Adding completely new features | We’re nearing the end of the project deadline(s) so we should rather focus our energy and time on deepening existing features, rather than coming up with new ideas. |
| Start | Having more concrete and in-depth PRs | Having in-depth PRs regarding the changes that have been made, will help us document all the functionality behind a feature of our application |
| Continue | Approving PRs in a timely fashion! | We’ve been doing a good job regarding not having any PRs back up, preventing merge conflicts from occurring, and new contributions to have the most recent code base! |

Team member: Thienan  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Only discussing what we have done in class | It will be more time effective to discuss our plans outside of class |
| Start | Detailing the acceptance tests for tasks before they are assigned | This will allow members to know what to complete for each PRs |
| Continue | Approving each others pull requests as they come up | This helps keep the code updated and allow people’s prs to not conflict |

Team member: Lawrence  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Focusing on small issues like UI | This causes the team to prioritize issues that could be done at a later time, causing main issues to still persist |
| Start | Detailing what to expect from our PR’s | It would be easier for reviewers to know what to expect from the new modifications which can make the code review more efficient |
| Continue | Building on feedback given from the MVP | MVP has some solid suggestions that the team can base on for ongoing issues for the app |

Team member: Jennifer  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | We should stop working on UI enhancements and focus on implementing features that relate to our User Stories. | We haven’t actually implemented the Task Manager and Calendar integration which is a priority. |
| Start | We should start being more consistent with our Sprint plannings. | If we aren’t making more Sprint plannings, team members might not know what they should focus on once they finish their current issue. |
| Continue | We should continue being active on Discord and Slack. | This keeps the team up to date and helps gauge the project’s overall progress. |

Team member: Cindy  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Working on UI enhancements | We should pivot to completing the functionality for our app as the final demo nears! |
| Start | Writing acceptance criteria for the issue before assigning it | We should provide clear objectives for the people assigned to the issue so that they know exactly what they need to implement. |
| Continue | Holding regular standups | Keeps the team up to date on product progress! |

Team member: Andrew  
| Start/Stop/Continue | Action | Rationale |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop | Stop working on small issues like UI. | By avoiding smaller tasks like UI concerns we can spend more time where the app really needs it. |
| Start | Start focusing on the most important features. | By spending more time on the most important features, the user can have the best functionality of our webapp when the product needs to be released. |
| Continue | Continue collaborating on our progress/tasks. | By sharing our current progress on issues we are working on, we can all have an idea of where everyone is at and assess where to focus our time. |

### Group Reflection

- A goal: We need to stop working so much on UI enhancements and focus on implementing features that relate to our User Stories.
- A change/experiment: We should lower the allocation of issues/responsibilities to UI features, and rather focus them to the big four features we stated earlier, we should be better prepared for more concrete feedback.
- A measurement: We will assign certain # of members to work on certain issues (within that issue members can split different features related to that issue)

## Retro Assessment

- For this retro, I chose to lead with the Start/Stop/Continue method. This allowed the team to identify what was/wasn't working from our previous Sprint planning meeting.
- Once everyone had contributed their observations, we took a vote on which action was most important in order to identify this week's priority/experiment.
- For the next retrospective, I recommend allocating (and sitting to) a specific amount of time for both individual and group reflections. This will ensure that all our necessary discussions are completed before the lab session ends.

## Experiment/Change

TBD

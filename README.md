# timewise
*Wisely manage your time*

## Project Description:
We are making a study timer web application with adaptive break suggestions based on tasks, deadlines, and personal schedules.
- **App Type:** Web App
- **Tech Stack:** React, Tailwind, Firebase, Google Calendar API, Google OAuth
- **Details:** timewise is a web app that allows users to input their tasks, focus, and schedule to generate a smart work plan that minimizes burnout and maximizes work efficiency. Students can use timewise to create effective study plans for their coursework or organize group study sessions. Beyond studying, users from all professions can improve their productivity and time management by syncing the app with their Google Calendar schedule. The app will plan time for tasks around their schedule based on difficulty and the user's energy level. During a study session, timewise will prompt users to take breaks based on their workload to improve focus.
